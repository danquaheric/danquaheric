## About Me 🚀

About Me 👋

Hi there! I’m Eric Danquah, a passionate Software Engineering student currently exploring the world of web development, backend systems, and emerging technologies. I’m driven by a deep curiosity for how things work and a desire to build solutions that make technology more useful, accessible, and impactful.

I enjoy working with tools and languages like Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Django, and I’m constantly improving my skills in API development, database design, and software architecture. My learning journey is focused on writing clean, efficient code and understanding the principles behind scalable and secure applications.

Beyond coding, I’m interested in cybersecurity, AI, and digital innovation—fields that inspire me to think critically about how technology can solve real-world problems. I also love collaborating on projects, sharing knowledge, and contributing to open-source communities that foster growth and creativity.

🔹 Current Focus: Backend & Frontend Development
🔹 Learning: System design, advanced algorithms, and DevOps basics
🔹 Goal: To become a well-rounded software engineer who builds secure, efficient, and meaningful digital solutions
